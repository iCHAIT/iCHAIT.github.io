# What we learned from our 9 months of online food ordering data


We spent close to **S$1579** on OLO's (online orders), tried **26 different restaurants**, spent close to **S$30 on an average per meal**.

* **Most used service** - foodpanda
* **Most Ordered Cuisine** - Indian
* **Costliest Cuisine** - Mexican (only 1 order)
* **Most # of orders on** - Friday
* **Cheapest service** - Deliveroo


### OLO Services Used

* [foodpanda](https://www.foodpanda.sg/) :panda_face:
* [Domino's](https://www.dominos.com.sg/) :pizza:
* [UberEats](https://www.ubereats.com/) :car:
* [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.com.sg/) :yum:


### Getting the data

We scarped all the orders from **foodpanda** and **Deliveroo** websites using python's [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests) and [beautifulsoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) library. 

For **UberEats**, god knows why but we were not able to see my order history on their website. We had only placed 5 orders via them, so it made sense to write those in manually rather scraping them using python which would have probably taken more time, and since [Uber is not operational in Singapore anymore](https://help.uber.com/h/1e6cfc45-10da-416c-a7a3-d13f75505c34) there was no point spending time on writing code that I won't be able to using in future anyway.

For **Domino's** we tried scraping the orders but realized that they are using virtual DOM, so essentially the problem boiled down to scraping JS rendered web page and came across Selenium which can be used to do this, gave it a shot but realized that it would take more time and effort then we could put in right now, and since the goal of the project was to learn from our data and not learn selenium I skipped it and wrote the data manually, luckily again I had placed only 7 orders with Dominoâ€™s so it was not that bad. But yeah, I have put this in my list of TODOâ€™s to do it when I have got more time, because for sure my order's with Domino's are going to increase over time (that is inevitable.)


Further, we wrote a script that merges OLO data from all these 4 services and gives us a consolidated file that contains all our orders over the past 9 months.

I saved 4 values for each of the order -  Cost, Items Ordered, Restaurant, Service

We have been using Tableau for quite a while and are totally in awe of the tool. Itâ€™s amazing UI, amazing charts, ease of use and performance made it a no brainer to choose it for this.


We found the following isnsights from our data -



## Number of Orders Increased Over Time ðŸ“ˆ


Initially, we didnâ€™t use to order food online much, we preferred cooking at home so there was not a single order in July and August, but as things became busier and we couldn't find time (and the motivation) to cook at home, we started ordering more. That is why there is a spike in November, when we gave up cooking at home entirely (just cooked eggs at the most.)

![Number of Orders](/assets/images/numordersvsmonths.png)
<figcaption class="caption">Number of Orders vs Months</figcaption>


As we started ordering frequently we received more promo codes and discount than ever before, which made sure that our orders increased steadily.

In **January** # of orders decreased since we were not in Singapore for the most part of it, we went back home since it was our semester break.<br/>
We ordered the most in the month of **April**, since I was down with Chicken pox and was confined to home for almost 2 weeks, so we had to resort to ordering online.


## Service Usage vs Months :clock1:

![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/serviceusagevsmonths.png)
<figcaption class="caption">Service Usage vs Months</figcaption>

The above graph indicates how we used each service over the months.

For **Dominoâ€™s** we have consistently placed **1 order every month** this was interesting, we realized this was due to the fact that they gave us a coupon for free pizza every time we ordered with them (on account of late pizza delivery on their part), sometimes we wonder if they do it on purpose and tie us down in vicious cycle as a result we end up ordering with them at least once a month to avail that free pizza.



## Most Used Service - Foodpanda :panda_face:


We wanted to find out how we used each service over the months. A quick view of Order statistics for each service reveals that foodpanda is our preferred service.<br>
This is particularly because they have a **beautiful UI**, have a **vast number of indian restaurants** and a **variety cuisines** on offer than any other service. Also, we get frequent promotional offers from them due to their tie ups with DBS and [LiveUp](https://member.lazada.sg/liveup/liveup-introduce/) which we make use of.
<br><br>
Our engagement with **UberEats** was mininal and we almost stopped using it. <br>
We placed our first order with Deliveroo last month and expect the orders to rise since the [ice has is broken now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q2X3yVwGMk).

![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/servicevsorderstats.png)
<figcaption class="caption">Service vs Order Stats</figcaption>

**Economy service: Deliveroo**

Although, we haven't ordered much to support the conclusion, however the avg. cost of meal has been lowest with Deliveroo orders. And we do feel that they have more [Hawker Centres](http://www.nea.gov.sg/public-health/hawker-management/hawker-centres-and-markets-in-singapore) (which provide low cost food across Singapore) listed on their app than any other service provider. Hence, we are definitely going to try Deliveroo more often and see if we  save some money.


**Most Expensive Service: Domino's**

Sure, they have done a great job in tying us down in their viscous cycle and extracted money from us effectively. An order from domino's cost us the most when compared to any other service.



## Avg cost of meal for restaurants :ramen:


Further, we wanted to find out avg cost of meal for each restaurant and cuisine that we have tried.<br>

[Zaffron Kitchen](https://www.foodpanda.sg/restaurant/s3su/zaffron-kitchen-westgate) (Indian Cuisine) costs us the most, and [Rangooli](https://www.foodpanda.sg/restaurant/v1bv/rangooli) is probably the best Indian restaurant (out of what we have tried via OLO) in terms of food quality, taste and cost.

For **Fast Food Chains**, **Domino's** is definitely costs on the higher side.

Cheapest of all is **McDonald's** which is expected.



![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/restaurantsvsorderstats.png)
<figcaption class="caption">Restaurants vs Order Stats</figcaption>

We found that for **Western Food**, avg. cost per meal is more or less consistent for all restaurants, while it varies significantly for **Indian** & **Italian Cuisine**.


![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/restaurantsvsorderstats2.png)
<figcaption class="caption">Restaurants vs Order Stats</figcaption>


## Most ordered cuisine :curry:


Further, we wanted to analyze which cuisines we order the most, and it was no surprise that it was **Indian**, with Fast food being the second highest (god, we need to stop eating PIZZA) followed by **Western**.


![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/perccuisineordered.png)
<figcaption class="caption">Most Ordered Cuisine</figcaption>


## Percentage of money spent on different cuisines :moneybag:

Then we wanted to find out how our spending varies with cuisine and based on the below pie chart, we found that almost 53% of the spending goes into **Indian Cuisine** which is expected since it is the most ordered cuisine. Followed by Fast food at 17% and Italian and Western both hovering at 12%


![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/perc$spent.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Percentage of $ Spent on different Cuisines</figcaption>


## Avg. cost per meal for each cuisine

Further, we were curious to know the avg cost per meal for each cuisine, and we found that **Mexican** is the costliest followed by **Italian** and **Indian** (not much to separate the 3).
**Western Food** cost us way less than the other cuisines so we should probably start eating Western more frequently in order to save some money.

![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/avgcostpercuisine.png)
<figcaption class="caption">Average Cost of meal for each Cuisine</figcaption>

In the above graph, **size of the square** is porpotional to avg. cost of cuisine, and the **darker the color** is propotional to higher number of orders.


## Months vs Order Stats

When we started ordering online, we didnâ€™t know how to order efficiently so we could order good food while saving money at the same time, hence we ended up spending more, however with time we have gotten better at ordering online as we can deduce from the graph below that the avg cost of our orders has decreased over time.


![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/monthsvsorderstats.png)
<figcaption class="caption">Trend of Money spent vs Months</figcaption>

There's a spike in **March**, the average cost per meal rose here since we hosted a couple of parties at our place and had friends over, so our orders were large and pretty expensive.


## Day of Week vs Order Stats

This was one of my favourite viz, we wanted to know if day of week affects our ordering pattern. The viz shows **no of orders** and **avg. cost of meal** for each day of week. <br>
We found that we are more likely to order online on **later part of the week (Thursday, Friday and Sunday)**. This is because we have lectures to attend on Monday, Tuesday on Wednesday so those days we usually stay in college and eat in the canteen itself, but in the later part of the week we tend to stay at home (since there are no lectures) as a result we tend to order a lot more.


![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/dayofweekvsorderstats.png)
<figcaption class="caption">Percentage of Cuisines Ordered</figcaption>

The **darker shade of the color depicts that the avg cost of meal is higher**. On **Saturday**, the avg cost of meal is higher thought the number of orders are not that much, it was another interesting thing we found and realized that on Saturdayâ€™s we usually go out for dinner since it is an off for both of us the next day, and whenever we order it was generally because we had friends over for house parties. That explains the higher cost of avg meal on Saturdayâ€™s.

## What's next


* Since all these food delivery apps bring you food form restaurants that are near you it does not reflect the tru picture, since we don't have numbers of restaurants that we have dined in. 
* Use data from Splitwise to fetch data from restaurants we dine in.
* Use selenium to scrape data from Domino's.
* Improve ordering habits and redo the analysis every 6/9 months to see if there is any improvement in ordering pattern (lowering avg cost, trying more restaurants, saving more)
* Use a food database API to gather nutrition value of each meal and cuisine/restaurant.
* Analyze meals data, to understand most preferred dish.
* Loose some weight, yeah man, after gorging on all these meals over the past 9 months I have become fatter than ever, need to hit the gym, it's **HIGHT TIME**.

## Disclaimer

In this post, we are by no means quantifying or generalizing any cuisine or any restaurant. Ordering food is a subjective activity and depends on several factors like - number of people eating, appetite, fondness of a cuisine, your locality, restaurants near you, restaurants listed on OLO service, your preference for service you use, how hungry you are at the time of ordering, gender, race, ethnicity, age, food allergies, any particular events (parties, vacation, injury/illness) that may have caused deviations in your order patterns and a lot more.

We did this for fun and this for us, we do not intend to define avg. cost of any cuisine, or avg cost of eating at any restaurant. We do not encourage you to start or stop eating any particular cuisine or ordering from a particular restaurant or service provider.

Please do keep in mind that you may get different numbers which maybe entirely different from ours. So please take it as a light and read it for fun.

Also, there exist only 1 order for many cuisines and restaurants so that is definitely not a good representation for that group I agree, but again we wanted to try it out with whatever data we had. It may be a case that these number changed entirely for us 6 months down the lane.
