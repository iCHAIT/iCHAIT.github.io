# What we learned from our 9 months of online food ordering data


We spent close to **`S$1472`** on OLO's (online orders), tried **`23 different restaurants`**, spent **`S$30 on an average per meal`**, ordered around `5 times a month` and spent approximately `S$163` on food OLO's each month.


* **Most used service** - foodpanda
* **Most Ordered Cuisine** - Indian
* **Costliest Cuisine** - Mexican (only 1 order)
* **Cheapest Cuisine** - Japanese (only 1 order)
* **Most # of orders on** - Friday
* **Highest cost per meal on** - Saturday
* **Cheapest service** - Deliveroo


### About Us

* Indian living in Singapore, student
* I live with my girlfriend, also a student
* 24 year old with no food allergy whatsoever


### OLO Services Used

* [foodpanda](https://www.foodpanda.sg/)
* [Domino's](https://www.dominos.com.sg/)
* [UberEats](https://www.ubereats.com/)
* [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.com.sg/)



### Getting the data

I scarped all the orders from `foodpanda` and `Deliveroo` websites using python's [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests) and [beautifulsoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) library. 

For `UberEats`, god knows why but I was not able to see my order history on their website. I had only placed 5 orders via them, so it made sense to write those in manually rather scraping them using python which would have probably taken more time, and since [Uber is not operational in Singapore anymore](https://help.uber.com/h/1e6cfc45-10da-416c-a7a3-d13f75505c34) there was no point spending time on writing code that I won't be able to using in future anyway.

For `Domino's` I tried scraping the orders but realized quickly that they are using the concept of virtual DOM, so essentially the problem boiled down to scraping JS rendered web page and I came across Selenium which can be used to do this. I gave it a shot but I realized that it would take more time and effort then I could put in right now, and since the goal of the project is to learn from my data and not learn selenium I skipped it and wrote the data manually, luckily again I had placed only 7 orders with Domino’s so it was not that bad. But yeah, I have put this in my list of TODO’s to do it when I have got more time, because for sure my order's with Domino's are going to increase over time (that is inevitable.)


Further, I wrote a script that merges OLO data from all these 4 services and gives me a consolidated file that contains all my orders over the past 9 months.

I saved 4 values for each of the order -  Cost, Items Ordered, Restaurant, Service


[Snapshot of order]

I have been using Tableau for quite a while and I am totally in love with the tool. It’s amazing UI, amazing charts, ease of use and performance made it a no brainer to choose it for this,I imported my OLO data into tableau and played with it  And the result was - 



### Number of Orders increased over time


Initially, we didn’t use to order food online much, we preferred cooking at home so there was not a single order in July and August, but as things became busier and we couldn't find time (and the motivation) to cook at home, we started ordering more. That is why there is a spike in November, when we gave up cooking at home entirely (just cooked eggs at the most.).

* Moreover, as we started ordering more we got more promo codes and discount than ever which made sure that our orders increased steadily.
* The orders in the month of January decreased since we were not in Singapore for most part of it, we went back home since it was our semester break.
* We ordered the most in the month of April, since I was down with Chicken pox and was imprisoned in home for 2 weeks, so we had to resort to ordering online.

### Most Used Service : Foodpanda


We wanted to find out how we used each service over the months. A quick view of Order statistics for each service reveals that foodpanda is our preferred service this is because we particularly like their UI, they have a vast number of restaurants and variety cuisine on offer and they probably have more Indian restaurants listed than any other service. Also, we get frequent promotional offers from them due to their tie ups with DBS and [LiveUp](https://member.lazada.sg/liveup/liveup-introduce/) which we make use of.
We almost stopped using UberEats. We placed our first order with Deliveroo last month and expect the orders to rise since the ice has is broken now.

For Domino’s we have consistently placed 1 order every month this was an interesting observation , we realized this was due to the fact that they gave us a coupon for a free pizza every time we ordered with them (on account of late pizza delivery on their part), sometimes we wonder if they do it on purpose and tie us down in vicious cycle as a result we end up ordering with them at least once a month to avail that free pizza.


### Economy service: Deliveroo

Although, we haven't ordered much to support the conclusion, however the avg. cost of meal has been lowest with Deliveroo orders. And we do feel that they have more [Hawker Centres](http://www.nea.gov.sg/public-health/hawker-management/hawker-centres-and-markets-in-singapore) (which provide low cost food across Singapore) listed on their app than any other service provider. Hence, we are definitely going to try Deliveroo more often and see if we  save some money.

#### Avg cost per meal for each restaurant we have ordered with


Here is a list of different restaurants that we have ordered with, this visualization helps in finding avg cost of meal for each restaurant and cuisine.
We found that for western food, avg cost per meal is consistent for all restaurants, while it varies significantly for Indian & Italian cuisine.

[Zaffron Kitchen](https://www.foodpanda.sg/restaurant/s3su/zaffron-kitchen-westgate) (Indian Cuisine) costs us the most, and we find that [Rangooli](https://www.foodpanda.sg/restaurant/v1bv/rangooli) is probably the best Indian restaurant (in the vicinity, out of what we have tried via OLO) in terms of food quality, taste and avg cost per meal.

For Fast Food chains, Domino's is definitely costs on the higher side.

Cheapest of all is McDonald's which is expected.

<figcaption class="caption">Restaurants vs Order Stats</figcaption>

Here is a list of different restaurants that we have ordered with, the main aim of this vizualization was to find avg cost of meal for each restaurant and cuisine. We found that for western avg cost per meal is more or less similar for all restaurants, while it varies significantly for indian restaurants.

<figcaption class="caption">Restaurants vs Order Stats</figcaption>


### Most ordered cuisine


We wanted to find out which cuisines we order the most, and it was no surprise that it was Indian cuisine, with Fast food being the second highest (god, we need to stop eating PIZZA) followed by Western food.

<figcaption class="caption">Percentage of Cuisines Ordered</figcaption>


### Percentage of money spent on different cuisines

Then we wanted to find out how our spending varies with cuisine and based on the below pie chart, we found that almost 54% of the spending goes into Indian cuisine. Followed by Fast food at 17% and Italian and Western both hovering at 11%

<figcaption class="caption">Percentage of Cuisines Ordered</figcaption>


### Avg. cost per meal for each cuisine

Further, we were curious to know the avg cost per meal for each cuisine, and we found that Mexican is the costliest followed by Italian and Indian (not much to separate the 3)
here we note that, western food cost us relatively less even when we have placed significant number of orders for it.

Japanese is the lowest of all, however since we have placed only 1 order for that too that may not give the true picture.

![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/avgcostpercuisine.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Average Cost per Cuisine</figcaption>

In the above graph, size of the square depicts avg cost per cuisine, and the darker the color means higher number of orders. So here, it is evident that Mexican, Italian, Indian and Fast Food have more or less similar avg cost while cost for western is lower than all of them.


### Months vs Order Stats

When we started ordering online, we didn’t know how to order efficiently and we ended up spending more, however with time we have gotten better at ordering online as we can see that the avg cost of our orders has decreased over time.

In March, the average cost per meal has risen since we had friends over for parties, so our orders were pretty large and expensive on those days.

<figcaption class="caption">Percentage of Cuisines Ordered</figcaption>


### Day of Week vs Order Stats

Then we were curious if day of week affects our ordering pattern. The viz shows no of orders and avg cost of meal for each day of week. We found that we are more likely to order online on later part of the week (Thursday, Friday and Sunday). We have lectures to attend on Monday, Tuesday on Wednesday so those days we usually stay in college and eat in college canteens itself so we don’t need to order online, but in the later part of the week we tend to stay at home (since there are no lectures) as a result we tend to order a lot more relatively.


![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/dayofweekvsorderstats.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Percentage of Cuisines Ordered</figcaption>

The darker shade of the color depicts that the avg cost of meal is higher. On Saturday, the avg cost of meal is higher thought the number of orders are not that much, it was another interesting thing we found and realized that on Saturday’s we usually go out for dinner since it is an off for both of us the next day, and whenever we order it was generally because we had friends over for house parties. That explains the higher cost of avg meal on Saturday’s.

### What's next


* Since all these food delivery apps bring you food form restaurants that are near you it does not reflect the tru picture, since we don't have numbers of restaurants that we have dined in. 
* Use data from Splitwise to fetch data from restaurants we dine in.
* Use selenium to scrape data from Domino's.
* Improve ordering habits and redo the analysis every 6/9 months to see if there is any improvement in ordering pattern (lowering avg cost, trying more restaurants, saving more)
* Use a food database API to gather nutrition value of each meal and cuisine/restaurant.
* Analyze meals data, to understand most preferred dish.


### Disclaimer

In this post, we are by no means quantifying or generalizing any cuisine or any restaurant. Ordering food is a subjective activity and depends on several factors like - number of people eating, appetite, fondness of a cuisine, your locality, restaurants near you, restaurants listed on OLO service, your preference for service you use, how hungry you are at the time of ordering, gender, race, ethnicity, age, food allergies, any particular events (parties, vacation, injury/illness) that may have caused deviations in your order patterns and a lot more.

We did this for fun and this for us, we do not intend to define avg. cost of any cuisine, or avg cost of eating at any restaurant. We do not encourage you to start or stop eating any particular cuisine or ordering from a particular restaurant or service provider.

Please do keep in mind that you may get different numbers which maybe entirely different from ours. So please take it as a light and read it for fun.

Also, there exist only 1 order for many cuisines and restaurants so that is definitely not a good representation for that group I agree, but again we wanted to try it out with whatever data we had. It may be a case that these number changed entirely for us 6 months down the lane.
