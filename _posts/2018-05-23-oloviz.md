### What we learned from my 9 months of online food ordering data


We spent close to $1472 on OLO's (online orders), tried 23 different restaurants, spent $30 on an average per meal. Ordered around 5 times a month and spent approximately $163 on food OLO's each month.


* **Most used service** - foodpanda
* **Most Ordered Cuisine** - Indian
* **Costliest Cuisine** - Mexican (only 1 order)
* **Cheapest Cuisine** - Japense (only 1 order)
* **Most # of orders on** - Friday
* **Highest cost per meal on** - Saturday
* **Chepaest service** - deliveroo


### About Us

* Indian living in Singapore, student
* I live with my girlriend, also a student
* 24 year old with no food allergy whatsover
* Moved to Sg: 27th July. 2017


### OLO services I used - 

* foodpanda
* dominos
* ubereats
* deliveroo



### Getting the data - 

I scarped all the orders from foodpanda and deliveroo websites using python's requets and beautifulsouip library. 

For ubereats, god knows why but I was not able to see my order history on their website. I had only placed 5 orders via them, so it made sense to write those in manually rather scraping them using python which would have probably taken more time, and since uber is not operational in Singapore anymore there was no point spending time on writing code that I won't be able to using in future anyway.

For domino's I tried scraping the orders but realized quickly that they are using the concept of virtual DOM, so essentially the problem boiled down to scraping JS rendered web page and I came across Selenium which can be used to do this. I gave it a shot but I realized that it would take more time and effort then I could put in right now, and since the goal of the project is to learn from my data and not learn selenium I skipped it and wrote the data manually, luckily again I had placed only 7 orders with Domino’s so it was not that bad. But yeah, I have put this in my list of TODO’s to do it when I have got more time, because for sure my order's with Domino's are going to increase over time (that is inevitable.)


Further, I wrote a script that merges OLO data from all these 4 services and gives me a consolidated file that contains all my orders over the past 9 months.

I saved 4 values for each of the order -  Cost, Items Ordered, Restaurant, Service

I have been using Tableau for quite a while and I am totally in love with the tool. It’s amazing UI, amazing charts, ease of use and performance made it a no brainer to choose it for this,I imported my OLO data into tableau and played with it  And the result was - 



### The Number of orders increased over time


We didn’t use to order food online much initially, there was not a single order in July and August since we preferred cooking at home,
but as things became busier and we couldn';t find time (and the motivation) to cook at home we started ordering more. That is why there is apike in November, when we gave up cooking at home entirely (just cooked eggs at the most.)

Gradually, as we started ordering we got more promo codes and discount as we ordered so number of order steadily increased.

The orders in January decreased since we were not in Singapore for the most part of it. We went back home since it was our semester break.

We ordered the most in the month of April, since I was down with Chicken pox and was imprisoned in home for 2 weeks, so we had to resort to ordering online.

<figcaption class="caption"># of Orders vs Months</figcaption>

As I mentioned earlier, we didn't use to order much initially as you can see from the vizualization there is not a a single order in July and August, but as things became busier we starting ordering more and more. We started ordering from September and even then we placed only 1 and 2 orders in September and October respectively. 

Gradually, we started getting promo codes and discount as we ordered so number of order steadily increased

<figcaption class="caption">Service Usage vs Months</figcaption>

The above vizualtion shows how we used each service over the months. Foodpanda orders have been consisten throughout. We almost stopped using ubereats which can be pertained to the fact that uber was not operational any more. We placed our first order with Deliveroo with last month and expect the order to rise. For Domino's we have consitently placed 1 order every month this is primarily due to the fact that they gave us a coupon for a free pizza every time we ordered with them.



### Most used Service : Foodpanda


The above vizualtion shows how we used each service over the months. Foodpanda orders have been consisten throughout, since it has been the leader in online food delivery here in sg. We almost stopped using ubereats. We placed our first order with Deliveroo last month and expect the orders to rise since the ice has been broken.
For Domino’s we have consitently placed 1 order every month this was an interesting observation , we realized this was due to the fact that they gave us a coupon for a free pizza every time we ordered with them ( on account of late pizza delivery on their part), sometimes we wonder if they do it on purpose and tie us down in vicious cycle as a result we end up ordering with them at least once a month to avail that free pizza.

A quick view of Order statistics for each service used shows that foodpanda is our preffered service since we particularly like their UI, they have vast number and variet of restarants listed and they probably have more indian restaurants listed than any other service. Also, they frequently give us promotional offers that we make use of frequently.


### Economy service: deliveroo

Although, we have ordered with deliveroo only twice but the avg cost of meal has been lowest of all, and I feel that they have more listing of hawker centres which provide low cost food. So we are definitely going to try deliveroo more often to cut down on expenditure.

<figcaption class="caption">Service vs Order Stats</figcaption>

Here's a quick view of Order statistics for each service used, foodpanda is clearly the most used service since I particularly like their UI very much and feel that they have more indian restaurants listed than any other service. Also, they frequently give us promotional offers that we make use of frequently.



#### Avg cost per meal for eacch restaurant we have ordered with


Here is a list of different restaurants that we have ordered with, this vizualization helps in finding avg cost of meal for each restaurant and cuisine.
We found that for western food, avg cost per meal is consistent for all restaurants, while it varies significantly for indian & italian cuisine.

Zaffron kitchen (Indian Cuisine) costs us the most, and we find that Rangooli is probably the best indian restaurant (in the vicinity, out of what we have tried via OLO) in terms of food quality, taste and avg cost per meal.

For fast food restaurants, Domino's is definitely on the higher side.

Cheapest is McDonald's which is probably expected.



![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/restaurantsvsorderstats.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Restaurants vs Order Stats</figcaption>

Here is a list of different restaurants that we have ordered with, the main aim of this vizualization was to find avg cost of meal for each restaurant and cuisine. We found that for western avg cost per meal is more or less similar for all restaurants, while it varies significantly for indian restaurants. 

![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/restaurantsvsorderstats2.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Restaurants vs Order Stats</figcaption>

For fast food outlets, domino's proves to be pretty expensive while McDonald's is pretty cheap even when compared any other cuisine.


### Most ordered cuisine


We wanted to find out which cuisine we ordered the most, and it had to be indian. with Fast food being the second highest (god, we need to stop eating PIZZA) followed by Western food.


![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/perccuisineordered.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Percentage of Cuisines Ordered</figcaption>

In the above viz, larger the size of text means higher the number of orders for that cuisine. Naturally, Indian is the most ordered cuisine, with Fast food being the second highest follwed by Western and Italian.


### Percentage of money spent on different cuisines

Then I wanted to find out how our spending varies with cuisne and based on the below pie chart, almost 54% of the spending goes into indian cuisine. Followed by Fast food 17 % and Italian and Western both clocked around 11 %


![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/perc$spent.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Percentage of Cuisines Ordered</figcaption>

Th above pie chart depicts that most of our spending is based on ordering Indian food. Followed by Fast food 17 % and Italian and Western both clocked around 11 %.


### Avg cost per meal for each cuisine

Finally, we wanted to fing out the avg cost per meal for each cuisine, and we found that Mexican is the costliest followed by Italian and Indian (not much to separate the 3)
here we note that, western food cost us relatively less even when we have ordered singinifacnt no of orders.

jpaanese is the lowest of all, however since we have placed only 1 order for that too that may not give the true picture.

![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/avgcostpercuisine.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Average Cost per Cuisine</figcaption>

In the above graph size of the sqaure depicts avg cost per cuisine, and the darker the color means higher number of orders. So here, it is evident that Mexican, Italian , Indian and Fast food have more or less similar avg cost while cost for western is lower than all of them on significant number of orders.


### Months vs Order Stats

When we started ordering online, we didn’t know how to order online efficiently and we ended up spending more, however with time we have gotten better at ordering online since we can see that the avg cost of our orders has somewhat decreased over time.

In March, the average cost per meal has risen swince we had a couple of parties at home and we had friends, so our orders were pretty large and expensive.


![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/monthsvsorderstats.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Percentage of Cuisines Ordered</figcaption>

When we started ordering online, we didn't know the art of ordering online efficiently since we were spending more, however with time we have gotten better at ordering online since avg cost of our orders has decreased over time.


### Day of Week vs Order Stats

Then we were curious if day of week affects our ordering pattern. The viz shows no of orders and avg cost of meal for each day of week. We found that we are more likely to order online on later part of the week (Thursday, Friday and Sunday). We have our classes on Monday, Tuesday on Wednesday so those days we usually stay in college and eat in college canteens so we don’t need to order online, but in the later part of the week we tend to stay at home (since no classes) as a result we order a lot more.

The darker shade of the color depicts that the avg cost of meal is higher. On Saturday, the avg cost of meal is higher thought the number of orders are not that much, it was another interesting thing we found and realized that on Saturday’s we usually go out for dinner since it is an off for both of us the next day, and whenever we order it was generally because we had friends over for house party. That explains the higher cost of avg meal on saturday’s.

The above vizualization shows no of orders and avg cost of meal for each day of week. We found that we are more likely to order online on later part of the week (Thursday, Friday and Sunday). We quickly realized that our classes were scheduled on Monday, Tuesday on Wednesday so those days we usually stayed in college and ate in college canteens so we didn't need to order online, but in the later part of the week since we had no classes so we tend to stay at home as a result we order a lot more. The darker shade of the color depits that the avg cost of meal is higher. On Saturday, the avg cost of meal is higher thought the number of orders are not that much, it was another interesting thing we found and realized that on Saturday's we usually go out for eating since it is an off for both of us, and whenever we order it was generally because we had friends over our house for a party. That explains the higher cost of avg meal on saturday's.

### What's next


* Since all these food delivery apps bring you food form restaurants that are near you it does not reflect the tru picture, since we don't have numbers of restaurants that we have dined in. 
* Use data from splitwise to fetch data from restaurants we dine in.
* Use selenium to scrape data from dominos.
* Improve ordering habits and redo the anlysis evry 6/9 months to see if there is any improvement in ordering pattern (lowering avg cost, trying more restaurants, saving more)
* Use a food database API to gather nutrition value of each meal and cuisine/restaurant.
* Analyze meals data, to understand most prefferred dish.


### Disclaimer

In this post, we are by no means quantifying or genralizing any cuisine or any restaurant. Ordering food is a pretty subjective activity which depends on several factors like - number of people eating, appetite, fondness of a cuisne, your locality, restaurants near you, restuarants listed on OLO service, your preference for service you use, how hungry you are at the time of ordering, gender, race, ethinicty, age, food allergy  any particular events (parties, vacation, injury/illness) that may have caused deviations in your order patterns.

We did this for fun and this for us, we do not intend to define avg cost of any cuisine, or avg cost per meal at a restaurant. We do not encourage you to start or stop eating any particular cuisne or start and stop ordering from a particular restaurant or service provider.

Please do keep in mind that you may get different numbers which maybe entirely different from ours. So please take it as a light and read it for fun.

Also, there exist only 1 order for many cuisines and restaurants so that is definitely not a good representation for that group I agree, but again we wanted to try it out with whatever data we had. It may be a case that these number changed entirely for us 6 months down the lane.
