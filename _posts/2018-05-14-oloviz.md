It's been almost a year since I moved to Singapore (not really, but it seems like it, since so much has happened) and one of the biggest hurdle I came across as soon as I arrived here was food, not that food isn't easily available or is too expensive it is just that my Mom has been cooking for me for the past 23 years and it never seemed an issue unitl now :(

Cutting long story short, I along with my girlfriend started ordering food online, initially we were a bit reluctant in ordering food online since it seemed pretty expensive as compared to local hawker centres and college canteens  and on top of that we had to pay and additional S$ 3 as delivery charges, but as time passes and we got busier it seemed like a viable option and we were ordering more than ever.

We have been ordering food online since September, 2017 till date. We used several services such as Foodpanda, uberearts, domino's and deliveroo. And cumalatively ordered 48 times across 9 months. A few days back I was placing another order on foodpanda when I realized that we have gotten decent enough number of orders and I can scrape these and analyze this.

So as soon as I was done with my end sem exams I was down to get this project moving. I opened my sublime text and wrote one of the snippets that I have written so many times - 

```python
import requests
```

That is how you web in Python.


Oh yeah, `requests` is probably one of the best python library out there and I absolutely love to use it.

The goal now was to scrape OLO data from all the services we haves used - 

* foodpanda
* deliveroo
* domino's
* ubereats


## Data Scraping

It was pretty easy to scrape data from foodpanda, I used beautifulsoup to filter out relavant DOM object and found my way out to get all the desired fields.

Since I was already logged in on my browser so I can just use those cookies in my script. So what I did was used the Networks tab and copied the browser command to get the order history page as a CURL command.

It looked very ugly so I used [this](https://curl.trillworks.com/) little tool to convert the curl request into python code


```python
    url = "https://www.foodpanda.sg/orders"
    cookies = {
	           'cookie': 'cookie obtained from above',
     }
     resp = requests.get(url, cookies=cookies)
```

I made these changes and ran the script.

And YESS!!! All my orders were in the command line. Then I just cleaned the data and save dit in a csv file.

Just a quick note here, if you are not a fan of python warnings (SSL warning in this case) then you may want to include this two-liner in your code just like I did - 

```python
from requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions import InsecureRequestWarning
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings(InsecureRequestWarning)
```

I saved 4 values -  Cost, Items Ordered, Restaurant, Service

I repeated the process for deliveroo and got the data for it as well.

For ubereats for some reason I couldn't see my past orders on the website, and since uber is not operational in Singapore anymore there was no point writing a code to scrape their website since I cannot order with them anyway in the future, moreover I only had placed 5 orders via them so I just wrote tehm in manually.

Domino's was the most interesting one. So I tried to scrape their website with the same approach as followed for deliveroo and foodpanda but EH!! I was fetching the contents of the exact same page which contained all my orders but I didn't see any of those in the html I got in the command line. I was bamboozled. How can this happen? I wondered, I could infer that Domino's has in a way masked the order with some ID's but I was not exactly sure what was happening here. So I called the senior web developer I know @dufferzafar to understand what actually was happening here. And found out that there is a concept of virtual DOM prevelant and that the developers of the Domino's website must be using React or something to get more control over this application. So essentially the probelm boils down to scraping a JS rendered web page and I came across Selenium which can be used to do this.

I gave it a shot but I realized that it won't be as easy I thought it would be and would take more time and effort then I could put in right now. So I decided to skip the scraping part for this and wrote the data manually, since I placed only 7 orders with Domino's so it was not that bad. But yeah, I have put this in my list of TODO's to do it when I have got more time.

Further, I wrote a script that merges OLO data from all these 4 services and gives me a consolidated file that contains all my orders over the past 9 months.


FINALLY!!


Now it was time for the interesting and more challenging stuff of this project - VISUALIZING the data.


I have been using Tableau for quite a while and I am totally in love with the tool. It's amazing UI, numerous customizations, ease of use.

I imported my OLO data into tableau and played with it for around 2 days.

And the result was - 



# Viz 1 - Number of Orders vs Months


![Number of Orders](/assets/images/numordersvsmonths.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption"># of Orders vs Months</figcaption>

As I mentioned earlier, we didn't use to order much initially as you can see from the vizualization there is not a a single order in July and August, but as things became busier we starting ordering more and more. We started ordering from September and even then we placed only 1 and 2 orders in September and October respectively. 

Gradually, we started getting promo codes and discount as we ordered so number of order steadily increased


![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/serviceusagevsmonths.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Service Usage vs Months</figcaption>

The above vizualtion shows how we used each service over the months. Foodpanda orders have been consisten throughout. We almost stopped using ubereats which can be pertained to the fact that uber was not operational any more. We placed our first order with Deliveroo with last month and expect the order to rise. For Domino's we have consitently placed 1 order every month this is primarily due to the fact that they gave us a coupon for a free pizza every time we ordered with them.



# Viz 2 - Service vs Order Stats


![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/servicevsorderstats.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Service vs Order Stats</figcaption>

Here's a quick view of Order statistics for each service used, foodpanda is clearly the most used service since I particularly like their UI very much and feel that they have more indian restaurants listed than any other service. Also, they frequently give us promotional offers that we make use of frequently.

# Viz 3 - Restaurants vs Order Stats


![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/restaurantsvsorderstats.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Restaurants vs Order Stats</figcaption>

Here is a list of different restaurants that we have ordered with, the main aim of this vizualization was to find avg cost of meal for each restaurant and cuisine. We found that for western avg cost per meal is more or less similar for all restaurants, while it varies significantly for indian restaurants. 

![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/restaurantsvsorderstats2.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Restaurants vs Order Stats</figcaption>

For fast food outlets, domino's proves to be pretty expensive while McDonald's is pretty cheap even when compared any other cuisine.


# Viz 4 - Cuisines


![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/perccuisineordered.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Percentage of Cuisines Ordered</figcaption>

In the above viz, larger the size of text means higher the number of orders for that cuisine. Naturally, Indian is the most ordered cuisine, with Fast food being the second highest follwed by Western and Italian.


![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/perc$spent.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Percentage of Cuisines Ordered</figcaption>

Th above pie chart depicts that most of our spending is based on ordering Indian food. Followed by Fast food 17 % and Italian and Western both clocked around 11 %.


![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/avgcostpercuisine.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Average Cost per Cuisine</figcaption>

In the above graph size of the sqaure depicts avg cost per cuisine, and the darker the color means higher number of orders. So here, it is evident that Mexican, Italian , Indian and Fast food have more or less similar avg cost while cost for western is lower than all of them on significant number of orders.


# Viz 5 - Months vs Order Stats


![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/monthsvsorderstats.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Percentage of Cuisines Ordered</figcaption>

When we started ordering online, we didn't know the art of ordering online efficiently since we were spending more, however with time we have gotten better at ordering online since avg cost of our orders has decreased over time.


# Viz 6 - Day of Week vs Order Stats


![Markdowm Image](/assets/images/dayofweekvsorderstats.png){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">Percentage of Cuisines Ordered</figcaption>

The above vizualization shows no of orders and avg cost of meal for each day of week. We found that we are more likely to order online on later part of the week (Thursday, Friday and Sunday). We quickly realized that our classes were scheduled on Monday, Tuesday on Wednesday so those days we usually stayed in college and ate in college canteens so we didn't need to order online, but in the later part of the week since we had no classes so we tend to stay at home as a result we order a lot more. The darker shade of the color depits that the avg cost of meal is higher. On Saturday, the avg cost of meal is higher thought the number of orders are not that much, it was another interesting thing we found and realized that on Saturday's we usually go out for eating since it is an off for both of us, and whenever we order it was generally because we had friends over our house for a party. That explains the higher cost of avg meal on saturday's.
